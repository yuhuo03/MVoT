This foundational part not only defines the knife's overall shape and purpose but also sets the stage for attaching other elements, such as the bolster and guard, that will enhance its functionality and safety.",

This addition is crucial as it not only enhances safety by preventing accidental slips onto the blade but also provides stability and support at the junction where the blade meets the handle, reinforcing the overall structure of the knife.",
